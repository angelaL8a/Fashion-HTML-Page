            What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of
            structure did you choose to implement?
          </h3>

          <p class="report_answer">
            My website is a reflection of my passion for fashion, aesthetics,
            art, and culture. I wanted to create an online space where people
            could immerse themselves in a world of style, beauty, and culture.
            The essence of my website is encapsulated in the statement:
            "Discover a world of style, beauty, and culture on our leading
            fashion page. Immerse yourself in an oasis of inspiration where the
            latest fashion trends, cutting-edge beauty tips, and fascinating
            cultural destinations converge." <br />
            My choice of structure was based on the idea of offering visitors a
            comprehensive and diverse experience. I decided to implement four
            different sections to address various aspects of my passion and
            interests. <br />The first section, "FASHION," is centered around
            everything related to fashion. Here, visitors can find the latest
            fashion news, get to know prominent fashion designers, explore the
            world of models, and stay updated on major fashion shows. <br />The
            second section, "BEAUTY," focuses on beauty and personal care. In
            this part of the site, users can discover the latest makeup and
            skincare tips, and also get a glimpse of the latest beauty
            magazines. <br />The third section, "CULTURE," encompasses a variety
            of cultural topics. Here, visitors can find news about sports,
            celebrities in the world of television and music, as well as explore
            iconic places that are aesthetically impressive.<br />
            The fourth section, "LIFESTYLE," transports visitors to an idealized
            world where everything is aesthetic, green, and serene. From luxury
            hotels to pink-themed cafes, this section offers a vision of an
            aspirational lifestyle and also provides everyday tips. <br />My
            goal with the website is to celebrate beauty in all its forms,
            whether through fashion, art, or culture. I want visitors to feel
            inspired to explore their own creativity and personal style while
            discovering new trends and exciting cultural destinations. I hope
            that my website serves as a beacon of inspiration and a reliable
            resource for those looking to immerse themselves in the exciting
            world of fashion, beauty, and culture.

            State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website
            (e.g. guest speakers, websites, artists, blogs).
          </h3>
          <p class="report_answer">
            1.The creativity of visionary fashion designers like Miuccia Prada,
            Coco Chanel, and Donatella Versace has always been a constant source
            of inspiration for me. Their masterpieces in fashion have not only
            left an indelible mark on the industry but have also transformed the
            way we view and experience clothing. <br />Coco Chanel, one of the
            most iconic figures in the history of fashion, revolutionized the
            industry by liberating women from the constraints of 20th-century
            fashion. Her focus on simplicity, elegance, and comfort broke with
            traditional trends and created the iconic "little black dress,"
            which has become a wardrobe staple for women worldwide. Chanel also
            introduced the use of masculine fabrics in women's fashion,
            transforming the concept of gender in clothing. <br />Miuccia Prada,
            on the other hand, is known for her ability to challenge
            expectations and create avant-garde fashion. Her focus on blending
            styles and merging the traditional with the modern has led to the
            creation of unique garments and accessories that defy conventional
            fashion norms. Additionally, Prada has been a pioneer in the
            collaboration between fashion and art, seamlessly fusing both
            disciplines. <br />Donatella Versace has left her mark on fashion
            through her boldness and her focus on exuberance and glamour.
            Continuing the legacy of her brother Gianni Versace, Donatella has
            taken the Versace brand to new heights with her emphasis on striking
            prints, vibrant colors, and daring silhouettes. Her ability to merge
            fashion with pop culture and music has made the Versace brand a
            symbol of luxury and bold style. <br />2. Leading fashion
            publications such as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Elle have been
            endless sources of inspiration. These magazines not only feature the
            latest trends in fashion and beauty, but also incorporate elements
            of art and culture. Their focus on quality presentation and visual
            storytelling has influenced how I have structured my website.
            <br />3. Some contemporary music artists, such as Billie Eilish, Lil
            Nas X and Rihanna, stand out for their flamboyant and unique style
            in the fashion world. Their outfits and creative stage looks have
            been a constant source of inspiration for my website. They have
            reminded me of the importance of originality and experimentation in
            fashion and art, and how fashion can be a form of artistic
            expression in itself.

            State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.
          </h3>
          <p class="report_answer">
            1. All images on my website have a descriptive alternative text (alt
            text). Alt text is critical for users who rely on screen readers or
            have visual impairments. It provides a textual description of the
            images, allowing these users to understand and engage with the
            content. <br />2. My website is designed to be responsive, meaning
            it adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures that
            users with different devices, including smartphones and tablets, can
            easily navigate and interact with the content without encountering
            issues related to layout or readability. <br />3. My Website offers
            an optional dark mode. This feature allows users to change the
            appearance of the site to a dark background version with light text.
            The dark mode can be beneficial for users who prefer lower contrast
            or who spend a lot of time browsing at night, thus reducing
            eyestrain.

        <div class="report">
          <h3 class="report_title">
            State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.
          </h3>
          <p class="report_answer">
            1. From the beginning, I focused on designing a clear and easy to
            understand navigation structure. The main menu is organized
            logically, with easily recognizable labels for each section or
            category. This helps users quickly find the content they are looking
            for without confusion or complications. In addition, I have used
            colors and visual elements to make the navigation more attractive
            and representative of the topics covered on each page. <br />2.
            Aesthetics play a key role in my website. I have incorporated high
            quality and visually stunning images that represent the content of
            each page. Colors have been carefully selected to convey the right
            feel for each topic. In addition, I have used the right amount of
            white space to enhance readability and ensure that the content
            breathes visually. This creates an aesthetically pleasing experience
            and makes the content easier to understand. <br />3. Proper
            paragraph formatting and displaying bulleted lists also contribute
            to making my website content more readable. Paragraphs are designed
            at an appropriate length to avoid eyestrain. This makes it easier
            for visitors to consume and better understand the content, making
            the experience more enjoyable and effective.

          <h3 class="report_title">
            State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How
            did you achieve that?
          </h3>
          <p class="report_answer">
            1. To ensure that my website was visually appealing and easy to
            navigate, I invested time in learning about web design and
            usability. I immersed myself in online resources and courses that
            addressed design principles, color theory, user interface (UI)
            design, and user experience (UX) design. Some valuable sources
            included YouTube channels such as Rachel How, UXTShili, and Gemma
            Helyer, who offer tutorials and tips on web design. I also explored
            the Dribbble platform for design inspiration and Mobbin for examples
            of mobile app designs. Participating in the design community on
            Behance was also essential to learn from other talented designers
            and their projects.
            <br />2. To implement the design and structure of my website, I had
            to learn to use specific tools and technologies. The CSS
            documentation and (MDN web docs) Mozilla Developer Network was an
            essential source for understanding and applying different styles
            accurately. On the other hand, I used the Coolors platform to learn
            how to develop attractive and cohesive color palettes that aligned
            with the aesthetics of my site. <br />3. I learned to use basic
            tailwind concepts, and it allowed me to set up layouts in a simpler
            and faster way, thanks to its focus on reusable classes that can be
            applied directly in the HTML code. I also researched and studied at
            W3Schools to learn about various implementations, such as creating
            interactive carousels. The W3Schools platform offers valuable
            resources and detailed tutorials on web technologies, which allowed
            me to understand how dynamic elements, such as carousels, work and
            how to effectively integrate them into my site.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="report">
          <h3 class="report_title">
            What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful?
            Why?
          </h3>
          <p class="report_answer">
            I managed to achieve the visual representation throughout my
            website. The combination of colors, images and typography was
            carefully selected to convey the aesthetic and feel I wanted to
            share with visitors. This creates a cohesive and engaging visual
            experience throughout the site. <br />Dividing the content into four
            sections that address different aspects of the art world from
            different points of view was a successful approach. This allows
            users to explore and immerse themselves in fashion, beauty, culture
            and lifestyle in an organized and easy-to-understand manner. Each
            section had its own thematic focus, providing variety and enriching
            the user experience. <br />From a technical standpoint, I feel I was
            successful in testing myself in implementing dynamic features. I
            developed carousels, loops, nested loops, accordions and tabs using
            JavaScript to enhance the interactivity of the site. I also included
            animations and transitions to make navigation and content
            exploration more engaging and immersive. These technical features
            enhanced the functionality of the site and provided a more dynamic
            experience.

        <div class="report">
          <h3 class="report_title">
            What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things
            differently another time?
          </h3>
          <p class="report_answer">
            One opportunity for improvement that I recognize is the inclusion of
            content in several languages in addition to English. I could further
            diversify the multimedia content on my site. In addition to images
            and videos, I could explore the possibility of including interactive
            content, such as data visualizations or 3D experiences, to make the
            experience even more engaging and educational. <br />In terms of
            accessibility, while I have taken important steps such as including
            alt text for images, making sure content is readable for screen
            readers, and enabling dark mode, I recognize that there is room for
            deeper and more significant improvement. For example, making sure my
            site is colorblind friendly, I would consider implementing various
            color modes that users can select according to their preferences.
            This would allow for greater customization and convenience. On the
            other hand, I would include options that allow users to adjust the
            size of the text. This would benefit people with visual impairments
            or those who prefer larger text sizes for better readability.
