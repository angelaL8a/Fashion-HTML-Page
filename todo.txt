! INTRODUCTION
- What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose 
to implement? 
My website is a reflection of my passion for fashion, aesthetics, art, and culture. I wanted to create an online space where people could immerse themselves in a world of style, beauty, and culture. The essence of my website is encapsulated in the statement: "Discover a world of style, beauty, and culture on our leading fashion page. Immerse yourself in an oasis of inspiration where the latest fashion trends, cutting-edge beauty tips, and fascinating cultural destinations converge."

My choice of structure was based on the idea of offering visitors a comprehensive and diverse experience. I decided to implement four different sections to address various aspects of my passion and interests.

The first section, "FASHION," is centered around everything related to fashion. Here, visitors can find the latest fashion news, get to know prominent fashion designers, explore the world of models, and stay updated on major fashion shows.

The second section, "BEAUTY," focuses on beauty and personal care. In this part of the site, users can discover the latest makeup and skincare tips, and also get a glimpse of the latest beauty magazines.

The third section, "CULTURE," encompasses a variety of cultural topics. Here, visitors can find news about sports, celebrities in the world of television and music, as well as explore iconic places that are aesthetically impressive.

The fourth section, "LIFESTYLE," transports visitors to an idealized world where everything is aesthetic, green, and serene. From luxury hotels to pink-themed cafes, this section offers a vision of an aspirational lifestyle and also provides everyday tips.

My goal with the website is to celebrate beauty in all its forms, whether through fashion, art, or culture. I want visitors to feel inspired to explore their own creativity and personal style while discovering new trends and exciting cultural destinations. I hope that my website serves as a beacon of inspiration and a reliable resource for those looking to immerse themselves in the exciting world of fashion, beauty, and culture.


! INSPIRATION
- State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers, websites, artists, blogs).

1.The creativity of visionary fashion designers like Miuccia Prada, Coco Chanel, and Donatella Versace has always been a constant source of inspiration for me. Their masterpieces in fashion have not only left an indelible mark on the industry but have also transformed the way we view and experience clothing.
--
Coco Chanel, one of the most iconic figures in the history of fashion, revolutionized the industry by liberating women from the constraints of 20th-century fashion. Her focus on simplicity, elegance, and comfort broke with traditional trends and created the iconic "little black dress," which has become a wardrobe staple for women worldwide. Chanel also introduced the use of masculine fabrics in women's fashion, transforming the concept of gender in clothing.
--
Miuccia Prada, on the other hand, is known for her ability to challenge expectations and create avant-garde fashion. Her focus on blending styles and merging the traditional with the modern has led to the creation of unique garments and accessories that defy conventional fashion norms. Additionally, Prada has been a pioneer in the collaboration between fashion and art, seamlessly fusing both disciplines.
--
Donatella Versace has left her mark on fashion through her boldness and her focus on exuberance and glamour. Continuing the legacy of her brother Gianni Versace, Donatella has taken the Versace brand to new heights with her emphasis on striking prints, vibrant colors, and daring silhouettes. Her ability to merge fashion with pop culture and music has made the Versace brand a symbol of luxury and bold style.

2. Leading fashion publications such as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Elle have been endless sources of inspiration. These magazines not only feature the latest trends in fashion and beauty, but also incorporate elements of art and culture. Their focus on quality presentation and visual storytelling has influenced how I have structured my website.

3. Some contemporary music artists, such as Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X and Rihanna, stand out for their flamboyant and unique style in the fashion world. Their outfits and creative stage looks have been a constant source of inspiration for my website. They have reminded me of the importance of originality and experimentation in fashion and art, and how fashion can be a form of artistic expression in itself.

! ACCESSIBILITY
- State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.
1. All images on my website have a descriptive alternative text (alt text). Alt text is critical for users who rely on screen readers or have visual impairments. It provides a textual description of the images, allowing these users to understand and engage with the content.
2. My website is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures that users with different devices, including smartphones and tablets, can easily navigate and interact with the content without encountering issues related to layout or readability.
3. My Website offers an optional dark mode. This feature allows users to change the appearance of the site to a dark background version with light text. The dark mode can be beneficial for users who prefer lower contrast or who spend a lot of time browsing at night, thus reducing eyestrain.

! USABILITY
- State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.
1. From the beginning, I focused on designing a clear and easy to understand navigation structure. The main menu is organized logically, with easily recognizable labels for each section or category. This helps users quickly find the content they are looking for without confusion or complications. In addition, I have used colors and visual elements to make the navigation more attractive and representative of the topics covered on each page.

2. Aesthetics play a key role in my website. I have incorporated high quality and visually stunning images that represent the content of each page. Colors have been carefully selected to convey the right feel for each topic. In addition, I have used the right amount of white space to enhance readability and ensure that the content breathes visually. This creates an aesthetically pleasing experience and makes the content easier to understand.

3. Proper paragraph formatting and displaying bulleted lists also contribute to making my website content more readable. Paragraphs are designed at an appropriate length to avoid eyestrain. This makes it easier for visitors to consume and better understand the content, making the experience more enjoyable and effective.

! LEARNING
State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that?
1. To ensure that my website was visually appealing and easy to navigate, I invested time in learning about web design and usability. I immersed myself in online resources and courses that addressed design principles, color theory, user interface (UI) design, and user experience (UX) design. Some valuable sources included YouTube channels such as Rachel How, UXTShili, and Gemma Helyer, who offer tutorials and tips on web design. I also explored the Dribbble platform for design inspiration and Mobbin for examples of mobile app designs. Participating in the design community on Behance was also essential to learn from other talented designers and their projects.

2. To implement the design and structure of my website, I had to learn to use specific tools and technologies. The CSS documentation and (MDN web docs) Mozilla Developer Network was an essential source for understanding and applying different styles accurately. On the other hand, I used the Coolors platform to learn how to develop attractive and cohesive color palettes that aligned with the aesthetics of my site.

3. I learned to use basic tailwind concepts, and it allowed me to set up layouts in a simpler and faster way, thanks to its focus on reusable classes that can be applied directly in the HTML code. I also researched and studied at W3Schools to learn about various implementations, such as creating interactive carousels. The W3Schools platform offers valuable resources and detailed tutorials on web technologies, which allowed me to understand how dynamic elements, such as carousels, work and how to effectively integrate them into my site.

! EVALUATION I
- What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?
I managed to achieve the visual representation throughout my website. The combination of colors, images and typography was carefully selected to convey the aesthetic and feel I wanted to share with visitors. This creates a cohesive and engaging visual experience throughout the site.
Dividing the content into four sections that address different aspects of the art world from different points of view was a successful approach. This allows users to explore and immerse themselves in fashion, beauty, culture and lifestyle in an organized and easy-to-understand manner. Each section had its own thematic focus, providing variety and enriching the user experience.
From a technical standpoint, I feel I was successful in testing myself in implementing dynamic features. I developed carousels, loops, nested loops, accordions and tabs using JavaScript to enhance the interactivity of the site. I also included animations and transitions to make navigation and content exploration more engaging and immersive. These technical features enhanced the functionality of the site and provided a more dynamic experience.

! EVALUATION II
- What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another time?
One opportunity for improvement that I recognize is the inclusion of content in several languages in addition to English.
I could further diversify the multimedia content on my site. In addition to images and videos, I could explore the possibility of including interactive content, such as data visualizations or 3D experiences, to make the experience even more engaging and educational.
In terms of accessibility, while I have taken important steps such as including alt text for images, making sure content is readable for screen readers, and enabling dark mode, I recognize that there is room for deeper and more significant improvement. For example, making sure my site is colorblind friendly, I would consider implementing various color modes that users can select according to their preferences. This would allow for greater customization and convenience.  On the other hand, I would include options that allow users to adjust the size of the text. This would benefit people with visual impairments or those who prefer larger text sizes for better readability.
